../TreasureHunt/3/egg/vines/Nunu/pasRoss is throwing a party. To avoid uninvited guests, he had his guard set up a dynamic password 
system.
Dean (an uninvited guest) plans to enter the party. He stood nearby the door and watched people enter.

Kirk approaches the door and the guard says "twelve". Kirk replies "six" and is allowed into the party.
Noah then approaches the door and the guard says "six". Noah replies "three" and enters the party.

Dean, confident that he understands the system, approaches the door. The guard says "eight".
Dean replies "four" and gets escorted off the property.

What should Dean have said?
