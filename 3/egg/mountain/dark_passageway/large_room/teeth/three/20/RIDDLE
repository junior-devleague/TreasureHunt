Kirk is condemned to death. He has the choice of going through three rooms.
One room is filled with a raging fire that is constantly fed gasoline.
Another room is filled with assassins with loaded guns.
The last room is filled with lions that haven't eaten in a week.

Which room is the safest for Kirk to go through?
