Kirk is on his way to his grandma's house for her birthday to deliver the cakes.
On the way to her house, there are 7 bridges, and a troll living under each bridge.
To pass each bridge, Kirk must pay a troll toll of half of his cakes. However, the trolls are nice and give one back each time.

How many cakes should Kirk bring if he wants to get to his grandma's house with 2 cakes?
